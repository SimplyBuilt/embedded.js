# Embedded.js

Embedded.js makes it easy to create and share responsive embeddable content.
The library will create IFRAMEs and help resize them automatically.

It is used by [SimplyBuilt](https://www.simplybuilt.com/) and works great
with our Embedded Widget feature!

## Details

Embedded.js consist of 3 parts:

1. The hook script which loads the embed script and acts as an anchor for
   where content will be embedded.
2. The embed script which dynamically creates IFRAME elements and communicates
   with them to determine the height.
3. The client script which is used within the embedded content
   so it can communicate with the top-frame

## Quick Example

Suppose we have some web content we want to be embeddable across the
web. The usual recipe for this is to embed the content through an IFrame.

Since this content may be consumed on a variety of devices, it needs to
be responsive and potentially variable in height. In order for embedding
to work well, the IFrame in the top document needs to be able to
dynamically resize itself to the height of the content. To achieve this we can
use Embedded.js!

First, we set up a script tag with the hook and a few data attributes:

```html
<script src="/js/hook.js" data-api="/js/embed.js" data-location="http://example.com/embeddable-content"></script>
```

The `data-api` attribute specifies where to find the embed script. 
The `data-location` attribute specifies the `src` attribute for the
dynamically created `<iframe>`.

Next, include the client script within the embedded content like so:

```html
<head>
  <script src="/js/client.js"></script>
</head>
```

Voil√†! We can now embed responsive content with ease!
